# Data Analytics Portfolio
## About me:
My name is Jacob Van Der Vaart. I have a background in biochemistry and have worked in various laboratory research roles. As a scientist, my favorite part of the job was always analyzing the data and creating interesting and insightful visuals. This passion for data analysis inspired me to get my master's of public health (MPH) degree in epidemiology. As an epidemiologist, I learned to analyze data, design experiments, and critically appraise published research. I have also expanded on what I learned and my degree and completed the Google data analytics certificate. I am excited to work in the world of analytics and improve health outcomes.
## Projects

### Life Expectancy in the US and Social Determinants of Health
In this project I explored the correlation of life expectancy and different social determinants of health. The goal was to clean the data and merge the 2 datasets and put the results into an interactive dashboard.\
**Data sources:**\
The life expectancy data were sourced from the [CDC](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?q=life%20expectancy&start=0&rows=10&url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/life-expectancy/index.html).\
The social determinants of health data were sourced from the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html)\

### Medicare Part D Drug Spending Analysis (2018-2022)
In this project, I analyzed Medicare Part D drug spending trends from 2018 to 2022. The focus was on cost increases, the impact of manufacturer competition, and drug categories with the highest price growth.

**Data sources:**  
The Medicare Part D spending data and drug classification data were sourced from the [CMS](https://data.cms.gov/).
